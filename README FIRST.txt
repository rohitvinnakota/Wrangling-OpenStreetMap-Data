For this project, I chose my city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada to audit.

http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=edmonton#map=14/51.6203/-0.0660

It is a fairly large city with a population of around a million

1) The street_audit_final ipynb file is a full documentation of code and explanation for this project. It is the main core of this project and the Final_project is the presentation of my findings.

2) I used the sample_testing file to test the data on a smaller 50 MB subset of the Edmonton OSM dataset. The attached sample file is not the same file used for testing
